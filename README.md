# Sci-Fi Tech Game
Game developed in unity using C# programming language. This is a Sci-Fi Tech game, developed during the Udemy course that I did.
This repository has all the files needed to compile the game, metadata, scripts, sprites, etc., so it is possible to download them and test the files and modify them for learning purposes.

## Requirements
For better compatibility it is necessary to use Unity 2021.3.2f1 lts, which was the version I used to make the game.

### Execution
Just open the Unity editor and drag the files into it, then Unity itself will configure and compile the files.
